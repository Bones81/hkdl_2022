            <h3>Groceries</h3>
                <p>Park 'n' Shop - literally in the same building as our hotel. Large and generally wide selection of foods.</p>
                <p>City Super - a large, nicer grocery store with more Western options in IFC Mall in Central</p>
                <p>Elements 360 - also a larger, more Western-focused grocery located in the Elements Mall off the Kowloon MTR stop</p>
            <h3>7-11</h3>
                <p>That's right. 7-11 is a totally legit option in HK (and many other parts of Asia). Great for quick bites or small meals. Can also sell beer, wine, and some booze. (They also sell SIM cards, travel adapters, over-the-counter remedies, umbrellas, and more!)</p>
            <h3>Disney's backstage 7-11</h3>
                <p>Your new best friend. The cashier never judges you, even though they've already seen you five times that day. Solid, cheap, quick meals and snacks. Plus we get a 15% Disney employee discount on every purchase!</p>
            <h3>Disney employee canteen/cafeteria</h3>
                <p>Very cheap. Sometimes good, sometimes meh, sometimes great. Fish breakfast is a hallowed caroler rite of passage. You will grow to love it.</p>

            <h3>Street Food</h3>
                <p>No trip to HK is complete without getting dim sum. Arguably the best place on the planet for dim sum, HK sports an endless roster of dim sum restaurants and quick-food outlets. A couple of our favorites are Dim Dim Sum and Tim Ho Wan.</p>

                <p class="img-caption">Dim sum spread at Dim Dim Sum.</p>
                <p>Another classic HK experience is eating some sort of mystery food item, usually from a street vendor. Curry fish balls, bubble waffles (i.e. egg puffs), random bao, octopus, pork jerky...You've got to try something!</p>
                <img class="list-pic" src="assets/Chinese Menu Weird Items.jpg" alt="food menu with strange items"/>
                <p class="img-caption">Authentic Cantonese restaurants advertise some ... odd items.</p>
                <p>Bubble/Boba Tea is a big business in HK, having been popularized in nearby Taiwan. You'll find boba tea everywhere. I recommend Tiger Sugar or ShareTea.</p>
