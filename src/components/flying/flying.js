            <h3 className="special-note"><em>UPDATE: Oct 11 2022</em> Flight info has been issued!</h3>
                <p>Looks like we're all on <a href="https://www.koreanair.com/us/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Korean Air</a>! Our respective flights all depart on Sunday, Oct 30th. Then we will connect to the same flight from Incheon airport in Seoul to Hong Kong. </p>
                <h4 className="special-note">Important Note: Our RAT COVID test (see above section on <a href="#covid-clearance">COVID clearance</a>) must be within 24 hours of the flight from Seoul to Hong Kong. That flight leaves at 20:00 (i.e. 8pm) local time on Oct 31. <br/><br/>
                Therefore, you must do your pre-flight rapid test and fill out the online HK health declaration form AFTER...</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>4:00AM, Sunday Oct 30, Los Angeles time</li>

            <h3>Change your seat!</h3>
                <p>You may be able to <a href="https://www.koreanair.com/reservation/search" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">change your seat</a> to one you prefer. May as well be as comfortable as possible for the long flight(s)! Use the "Airline Booking Ref" from our flight email to search for your itinerary, as seen in the screenshot here:</p>

            <h3>Baggage</h3>
                <p>Looks like we get two complimentary checked bags up to 50lbs, a 1 bag + 1 personal item to carry on (total carry on weight is 22lbs). The fees are hefty for exceeding the weight limits.</p>
                <p>Historically, I have traveled with 2 checked rolling suitcases/bags, a medium-sized duffle bag, and a medium-sized backpack. It's basically as much as I can handle by myself. But remember, you can buy just about ANYTHING in HK, so if you don't need it, leave it at home. Number one rule of traveling: don't overpack.</p>
                <p>It is always possible that a checked bag could get lost, so it is extremely useful to have a full complement of essential clothes, food, chargers/power, and entertainment in your carry-on luggage.</p>
            <h3>In-flight meals</h3>
                <p>Check your respective initial leg tickets for what meal service you'll be getting. For the final leg, we will get dinner. Here is <a href="https://www.koreanair.com/us/en/in-flight/onboard-service/dining/economy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Korean Air's info on in-flight meals</a>, including options for <a href="https://www.koreanair.com/us/en/in-flight/onboard-service/dining/special-meals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">special meal requests</a>.</p>
            <h3>In-flight entertainment</h3>
                <p>Korean Air's <a href="https://www.koreanair.com/in-flight/entertainment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" >in-flight entertainment options are here</a>.</p>
            <h3>Frequent Flier program</h3>
                <p>A flight to HK is a huge number of miles! Take advantage of your airline's frequent flier program and ensure that your flight(s) counts toward your miles!</p>
                <p>Here is a link to the <a href="https://www.koreanair.com/us/en/skypass/status-benefits/status-benefits/grade/skypass-club" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Korean Air frequent flier program</a>. Looks like there might be a way to connect to Delta or Alaska Airlines miles??  </p>
            <h3>Mask recommendation</h3>
