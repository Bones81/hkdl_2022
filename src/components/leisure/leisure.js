            <h3>Other attractions</h3>
                <ul className='leisure-ul'>
                    <li>Central - As the name implies, this district is 'central' to just about everything that happens in HK. Central is located on the southern side of Victoria Harbour, across from TST. It contains a transportation hub, government buildings, banks, restaurants/bars, cultural hotspots, street markets, trendy shopping, fancy hotels...basically one of HK's two "downtowns," with TST being the other.</li>
                    <li>Tsim Sha Tsui, aka TST - loads of fun to be had in TST. Plus, our hotel offers a cheap, frequent shuttle that takes you directly to/from the district.</li>
                    <li>Wan Chai/Causeway Bay - Wan Chai has some 'edgier' bars and restaurants, and Causeway Bay is a shopping/food epicenter. It even has its own "Times Square."</li>
                    <li>Ocean Park - the other theme park in Hong Kong: part amusement park, part zoo, and part aquarium!</li>
                    <img className="list-pic" src="./assets/Ocean Park Panda.jpg" alt='ocean park panda'/>
                    <p className="img-caption">See Pandas at Ocean Park</p>
                    <li>Stanley - a neighborhood in the extreme southeastern part of HK that has great ocean views, promenades, shopping, restaurants, and a prison museum</li>
                    <li>Lamma Island</li>
                    <li>Cheung Chau Island</li>
                    <li>Tai O fishing village</li>
                    <li>Sai Kung - a beautiful region in the extreme northeast part of HK featuring beaches, epic hikes, and a lively port neighborhood</li>
                    <li>Day trip to Macau - This one may not be an option this year, as it involves leaving HK. 😭 But is is the Vegas of the East. Walk a casino floor, have a Portuguese egg tart (or seven), and see The House of Dancing Water, one of the most amazing shows you'll ever see.</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>Flower Market/Bird Market</li>
                    <li>Basically every metro station is connected to a mall because the malls and the public transportation are owned by the same entity, or so I have heard.</li>
                    <li>T-Town, close to our hotel</li>

                </ul>
            <h3>Night Life</h3>
                <h4 className="special-note">At the time I'm writing this, gatherings in HK are severely restricted, so it's not clear how much "night life" will be available to experience by the time we are there.</h4>
                <ul className='leisure-ul'> 
                    <li>Ned Kelly's Last Stand - the bandleader is one of our best friends in HK</li>

                </ul>
            <h3>Hiking</h3>
                <p>Hiking in Hong Kong is one of the most rewarding activities you can do! Fresh air, exercise, exotic plants, occasional monkeys, and the views...oh man, the views.</p>
                <ul className='leisure-ul'>
                    <li>Dragon's Back</li>

            <h3>Celebrating Holidays</h3>
                {/* <h4>Halloween 🎃</h4>
                <p>We are often invited to a Halloween party. Often, we just hold our own so that we aren't out partying far from home.</p>
                <p>Trick-or-Treating is not so much a thing in Hong Kong, but that doesn't have to stop us from tricking-or-treating with each other! </p>
                <p>Halloween spirit may be quite suppressed this year, at the park especially (since all the Halloween shows were cancelled). Again, that doesn't have to stop us if we want to celebrate a little.</p> */}
                <h4>Thanksgiving 🦃</h4>
                <p>We have historically coordinated a group Thanksgiving get-together. Last year, we even invited our stage managers who brought fun local foods and desserts to add to the potluck dinner.</p>
                <img className="list-pic" src="./assets/Thanksgiving 2019.jpg" alt='Thanksgiving 2019'/>
                <p>Everyone chooses a classic Thanksgiving item (or two) to contribute. Given the lack of ovens, we have developed our own tradition of someone bringing IKEA meatballs to be the "main" course. But all the usual classics have appeared: mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce, stuffing, sweet potatoes, mini pumpkin pies, green beans, brussels sprouts, wine, cocktails, etc.!</p>
                <h4>Christmas 🎁</h4>
                <p>By the time Christmas rolls around, we are usually pretty pooped. We have historically worked six-day (overtime) weeks during the two weeks leading up to Christmas.</p>
                <p>While we have always done group gifts for the stage managers from the carolers, we have never done a secret Santa or the like for each other. But that doesn't mean we couldn't... I suspect that we're all just a little overwhelmed by this point of the contract, what with the emotions of Christmas week, followed by the sober reality of the end of the contract just over a week later. It is exhausting.</p>
                <p>In all likelihood, we will be working on Christmas Day, which falls on a Sunday this year (2022).</p>
